📝 Customer Support Ticket Classification
📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to automatically classify customer support tickets into predefined categories based on their descriptions. This helps improve customer service efficiency by routing tickets to the correct department automatically.

⚙️ Methodology / Approach
✅ Data Preprocessing

Loaded and cleaned the dataset (customer_support_tickets.csv).

Selected relevant columns: Ticket ID, Ticket Description, and Ticket Type.

Dropped missing values.

✅ Exploratory Step:

Used a zero-shot classification model (facebook/bart-large-mnli) from Hugging Face Transformers to see how well an off-the-shelf model could predict ticket types without training.

✅ Label Encoding & Splitting:

Encoded ticket types as numeric labels using LabelEncoder.

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

✅ Model & Tokenization:

Used the bert-base-uncased model for fine-tuning.

Tokenized ticket descriptions with truncation and padding.

✅ Training:

Fine-tuned using Hugging Face Trainer API with:

Batch size: 8

Learning rate: 2e-5

Epochs: 3

Weight decay: 0.01

✅ Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance on the test set.

Computed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📊 Key Results / Observations
Fine-tuned BERT model achieved strong performance in classifying support tickets into correct categories.

The initial zero-shot approach provided reasonable predictions, showing the potential of pretrained language models even without fine-tuning.

Fine-tuning further improved accuracy and F1-score on unseen data.
